## Overview

**Cloud-Based Learning Management System (LMS)** is a robust and scalable platform that enables teachers to upload video-based courses and students to enroll, pay, and stream content securely. The platform is fully serverless and optimized for cost, performance, and security.

## Role-Based Functionality

- **Teacher Role**:
  - Teachers can securely sign in via Clerk and access their dashboard.
  - They can upload large course videos directly to AWS S3 using pre-signed URLs.
  - Teachers can create courses, manage uploaded content, and track enrolled students.

- **Student Role**:
  - Students can browse available courses and enroll through a secure, Stripe-integrated multi-step checkout process.
  - Once enrolled, students gain access to streaming content delivered through CloudFront with pre-signed URLs, ensuring time-limited access to private videos.
  - Students can view purchase history and securely manage their course dashboard.

## Frontend Implementation

- Built using **Next.js** with dynamic routing and React Server Components.
- Applied **Tailwind CSS** and **Radix UI** for building a responsive, accessible user interface.
- Clerk was integrated on the frontend for authentication and role management.
- User flows include course discovery, payment, dashboard access, and secure video viewing.
- Hosted on **Vercel** with GitHub-based CI/CD workflows for seamless deployment and rollback.

## Backend Architecture

- The backend was developed using **Express.js** and Dockerized for portability.
- All routes are secured and validated to enforce user roles (teacher/student).
- Video upload requests generate **pre-signed S3 URLs**, allowing large file transfers while bypassing the 10MB API Gateway limit.
- Data is stored in **Amazon DynamoDB**, organizing courses, enrollments, and transactions with efficient NoSQL schema.
- Stripe is used to handle secure payments, supporting multi-step checkout and authenticated user validation.

## AWS Integration

- **AWS S3** stores all uploaded video content.
- **AWS CloudFront** is used to distribute videos securely using pre-signed CloudFront URLs, enabling time-restricted streaming access.
- **Pre-Signed S3 URLs** allow teachers to upload large video files directly without routing through the backend.
- The backend is Dockerized and deployed to **AWS Lambda** using `serverless-http`, ensuring scalability and cost-efficiency.
- **API Gateway** serves as the secure entry point for all backend HTTP requests and routes them to Lambda functions.
- DynamoDB is used to store all critical app data (courses, users, payments), offering high availability and scalability.

## Deployment & DevOps

- The frontend is deployed on **Vercel**, using automatic deployment pipelines triggered by GitHub commits.
- The backend runs on **AWS Lambda**, deployed via the Serverless Framework with Docker support.
- Leveraged **Git** and modular design patterns for maintainability and collaborative development.
